# Understanding the File System

The Linux file system is the backbone of the operating system, organizing files and directories in a hierarchical structure. Understanding this structure is crucial for efficient navigation, file management, and system administration, especially in bioinformatics where handling large datasets and numerous files is common.

## Directory Structure in Linux

### Overview

The Linux file system is organized as a **hierarchical tree**, starting from the root directory `/`. Unlike Windows, which uses drive letters like `C:\`, Linux treats all storage devices and partitions as part of this single tree structure.

### The Root Directory `/`

At the top of the hierarchy is the **root directory**, denoted by `/`. All other files and directories stem from this root.

### Key Directories and Their Purposes

Here's a tour of the most important directories you'll encounter:

- **`/bin`**: Essential user command binaries (programs) needed in single-user mode; for all users.

  - **Examples**: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `mkdir`

- **`/sbin`**: System binaries; essential system administration commands.

  - **Examples**: `ifconfig`, `reboot`, `shutdown`

- **`/etc`**: Configuration files for the system.

  - Contains system-wide configuration files and directories.

- **`/home`**: Home directories for all users.

  - **Example**: `/home/jane` is Jane's home directory.

- **`/root`**: Home directory for the root user (the superuser).

- **`/lib`**: Essential shared libraries and kernel modules.

- **`/usr`**: User programs and data (secondary hierarchy).

  - **`/usr/bin`**: Non-essential user command binaries.

  - **`/usr/lib`**: Libraries for `/usr/bin` and `/usr/sbin`.

  - **`/usr/local`**: Programs installed locally from source or manual installation.

- **`/var`**: Variable data files.

  - Logs, databases, email spools.

- **`/tmp`**: Temporary files.

  - Storage for temporary files created by programs.

- **`/dev`**: Device files.

  - Represents hardware devices as files (e.g., `/dev/sda` for a hard drive).

- **`/proc`**: Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files.

  - Contains information about system processes.

- **`/mnt`** and **`/media`**: Mount points for removable media.

  - **`/mnt`**: Temporary mount points.

  - **`/media`**: Automatic mount points for removable devices.

### Visual Representation

Here's a simplified representation of the Linux file system hierarchy:

```
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
│   ├── jane
│   └── john
├── lib
├── media
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── sbin
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

**Analogy**: Think of the Linux file system as an inverted tree, with the root `/` at the top and branches (directories) extending downward.

**Fun Fact**: In Unix and Linux, "Everything is a file." This includes hardware devices, which are represented as files under `/dev`.

---

## Absolute vs. Relative Paths

Understanding paths is essential for navigating the file system and manipulating files and directories.

### Absolute Paths

An **absolute path** specifies the complete path to a file or directory from the root `/`.

- **Syntax**: Always starts with `/`.

- **Example**:

  ```bash
  /home/jane/Documents/report.txt
  ```

- **Usage**: Provides an unambiguous way to specify a location, regardless of the current working directory.

### Relative Paths

A **relative path** specifies the path to a file or directory relative to the current working directory.

- **Syntax**: Does not start with `/`.

- **Special Symbols**:

  - `.` (dot): Represents the current directory.

  - `..` (double dot): Represents the parent directory.

- **Examples**:

  - **To access a subdirectory**:

    ```bash
    cd projects
    ```

  - **To move up one directory**:

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

  - **Combined**:

    ```bash
    cd ../scripts
    ```

### When to Use Each Type

- **Absolute Paths**:

  - Use when writing scripts or cron jobs where the working directory may vary.

  - Ensures the correct file or directory is specified.

- **Relative Paths**:

  - Convenient for interactive use when working within known directory structures.

  - Shorter to type.

### Examples in Practice

Assume the current directory is `/home/jane`.

- **Using Absolute Path**:

  ```bash
  $ cd /var/log
  ```

- **Using Relative Path**:

  ```bash
  $ cd Documents
  ```

  Moves to `/home/jane/Documents`.

- **Navigating Up and Down**:

  ```bash
  $ cd ../john/Downloads
  ```

  Moves to `/home/john/Downloads`.

## File Operations: Copying, Moving, and Deleting Files and Directories

Managing files and directories is a fundamental aspect of working with the Linux file system. The following commands allow you to copy, move, and remove files and directories.

### Copying Files and Directories with `cp`

The `cp` command is used to copy files and directories from one location to another.

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
cp [options] source destination
```

#### Common Options

- **`-r` or `-R`**: Recursively copy directories and their contents.

- **`-i`**: Interactive mode; prompts before overwriting.

- **`-v`**: Verbose mode; displays files being copied.

#### Examples

- **Copy a file to another directory**:

  ```bash
  cp file.txt /home/jane/Documents/
  ```

- **Copy and rename a file**:

  ```bash
  cp file.txt /home/jane/Documents/copy_of_file.txt
  ```

- **Copy a directory and its contents recursively**:

  ```bash
  cp -r /home/jane/projects /home/jane/backup/
  ```

- **Prompt before overwriting existing files**:

  ```bash
  cp -i data.csv /home/jane/backup/
  ```

### Moving and Renaming Files and Directories with `mv`

The `mv` command moves or renames files and directories.

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
mv [options] source destination
```

#### Common Options

- **`-i`**: Interactive mode; prompts before overwriting.

- **`-v`**: Verbose mode; displays files being moved or renamed.

#### Examples

- **Move a file to another directory**:

  ```bash
  mv report.pdf /home/jane/Documents/
  ```

- **Rename a file**:

  ```bash
  mv old_name.txt new_name.txt
  ```

- **Move and rename a file simultaneously**:

  ```bash
  mv old_name.txt /home/jane/Documents/new_name.txt
  ```

- **Move a directory**:

  ```bash
  mv /home/jane/old_project /home/jane/Documents/new_project
  ```

### Deleting Files and Directories with `rm` and `rmdir`

The `rm` command removes (deletes) files and directories, while `rmdir` removes empty directories.

#### Deleting Files with `rm`

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
rm [options] file
```

#### Common Options

- **`-i`**: Interactive mode; prompts before deleting.

- **`-f`**: Force deletion without prompts.

- **`-r` or `-R`**: Recursively delete directories and their contents.

#### Examples

- **Delete a file**:

  ```bash
  rm unwanted_file.txt
  ```

- **Prompt before deleting a file**:

  ```bash
  rm -i important_file.txt
  ```

- **Force delete a file without prompts**:

  ```bash
  rm -f temp_file.txt
  ```

- **Recursively delete a directory and its contents**:

  ```bash
  rm -r old_projects/
  ```

  **Warning**: Use with caution; this command deletes everything within the specified directory.

#### Deleting Empty Directories with `rmdir`

The `rmdir` command deletes empty directories.

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
rmdir directory
```

#### Example

- **Delete an empty directory**:

  ```bash
  rmdir empty_folder
  ```

#### Note

- If the directory is not empty, `rmdir` will not delete it.

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Copying Multiple Files

- **Copy all `.txt` files to a backup directory**:

  ```bash
  cp *.txt /home/jane/backup/
  ```

#### Example 2: Moving Files with Confirmation

- **Move files to a new directory, prompting before overwriting**:

  ```bash
  mv -i *.csv /home/jane/data/
  ```

#### Example 3: Removing Files Interactively

- **Delete files, prompting for each confirmation**:

  ```bash
  rm -i *.log
  ```

#### Example 4: Safely Deleting Directories

- **Recursively delete a directory after careful consideration**:

  ```bash
  rm -r /home/jane/old_backups/
  ```

  **Tip**: Use `rm -ri` to prompt for confirmation before deleting each file and subdirectory.

### Important Notes on File Deletion

- **Deleted files are not moved to a recycle bin**: Once you delete a file with `rm`, it is permanently removed.

- **Use `rm` with caution**: Especially when using recursive deletion (`-r`), ensure you have specified the correct directory.

## File Permissions

Linux is a multi-user system, and file permissions are crucial for security and collaboration. They determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories.

### Understanding File Permissions

Use the `ls -l` command to view detailed file information, including permissions.

**Example Output**:

```bash
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 jane users  1024 Sep 10 12:34 file.txt
drwxr-xr-x 2 jane users  4096 Sep 10 12:35 directory
```

**Breaking Down the Output**:

- **`-rw-r--r--`**: File permissions.
- **`1`**: Number of hard links.
- **`jane`**: Owner (user).
- **`users`**: Group.
- **`1024`**: File size in bytes.
- **`Sep 10 12:34`**: Modification date and time.
- **`file.txt`**: File name.

### Understanding the Permission String

The permission string has 10 characters:

- The first character indicates the type:

  - `-`: Regular file.
  - `d`: Directory.
  - `l`: Symbolic link.

- The next nine characters are grouped into three sets of three:

  - **User (Owner)**: Positions 2-4.
  - **Group**: Positions 5-7.
  - **Others (World)**: Positions 8-10.

- Each set represents permissions:

  - **`r`**: Read permission.
  - **`w`**: Write permission.
  - **`x`**: Execute permission.
  - **`-`**: No permission.

**Example**:

- **`-rw-r--r--`**:

  - **User**: `rw-` (read and write).
  - **Group**: `r--` (read only).
  - **Others**: `r--` (read only).

### Reading File Permissions

**To check permissions**:

```bash
$ ls -l [file_or_directory]
```

**Interpreting Permissions**:

- **Read (`r`)**:

  - **Files**: Can view the contents.
  - **Directories**: Can list the contents.

- **Write (`w`)**:

  - **Files**: Can modify the contents.
  - **Directories**: Can add or delete files.

- **Execute (`x`)**:

  - **Files**: Can execute the file as a program/script.
  - **Directories**: Can access files and subdirectories within (traverse).

### Changing Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command changes the permissions of a file or directory.

#### Using Symbolic Mode

**Syntax**:

```bash
$ chmod [who][operator][permissions] [file_or_directory]
```

- **Who**:

  - `u`: User (owner).
  - `g`: Group.
  - `o`: Others.
  - `a`: All (user, group, and others).

- **Operator**:

  - `+`: Add permission.
  - `-`: Remove permission.
  - `=`: Set exact permission.

- **Permissions**:

  - `r`: Read.
  - `w`: Write.
  - `x`: Execute.

**Examples**:

- **Add execute permission for the user**:

  ```bash
  $ chmod u+x script.sh
  ```

- **Remove write permission for group and others**:

  ```bash
  $ chmod go-w file.txt
  ```

- **Set read and write permissions for all**:

  ```bash
  $ chmod a=rw file.txt
  ```

#### Using Numeric Mode

Permissions can also be represented numerically.

- **Permission Values**:

  - `r`: 4
  - `w`: 2
  - `x`: 1

- **Calculate the sum for each set**:

  - **User**: `rwx` (4+2+1) = 7
  - **Group**: `r-x` (4+0+1) = 5
  - **Others**: `r-x` (4+0+1) = 5

**Syntax**:

```bash
$ chmod [mode] [file_or_directory]
```

**Examples**:

- **Set permissions to `rwxr-xr-x` (755)**:

  ```bash
  $ chmod 755 program
  ```

- **Set permissions to `rw-rw-r--` (664)**:

  ```bash
  $ chmod 664 document.txt
  ```

**Common Permission Modes**:

- **700**: Owner can read, write, execute; others have no permissions.
- **644**: Owner can read and write; others can read.
- **600**: Owner can read and write; others have no permissions.

### Changing Ownership with `chown`

The `chown` command changes the owner and/or group of a file or directory.

**Syntax**:

```bash
$ sudo chown [user][:group] [file_or_directory]
```

- **Note**: Changing ownership typically requires superuser privileges (`sudo`).

**Examples**:

- **Change owner to `jane`**:

  ```bash
  $ sudo chown jane file.txt
  ```

- **Change owner to `jane` and group to `research`**:

  ```bash
  $ sudo chown jane:research data/
  ```

- **Change group only**:

  ```bash
  $ sudo chown :research data/
  ```

### Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Making a Script Executable

You have a script `analyze.sh` that needs to be executable.

```bash
$ ls -l analyze.sh
-rw-r--r-- 1 jane users  1024 Sep 10 12:34 analyze.sh
```

**Add execute permission for the user**:

```bash
$ chmod u+x analyze.sh
```

**Verify**:

```bash
$ ls -l analyze.sh
-rwxr--r-- 1 jane users  1024 Sep 10 12:34 analyze.sh
```

#### Example 2: Securing a File

You want to ensure that only you can read and write to `secret_data.txt`.

```bash
$ chmod 600 secret_data.txt
```

**Permissions now**:

```bash
$ ls -l secret_data.txt
-rw------- 1 jane users  2048 Sep 10 12:35 secret_data.txt
```

#### Example 3: Changing Ownership

As an administrator, you need to transfer ownership of `project/` to user `john`.

```bash
$ sudo chown -R john:users project/
```

- **`-R`**: Recursively change ownership for all files and subdirectories.

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: File Operations Practice

- **Task**: Practice copying, moving, and deleting files.

  1. **Create a directory named `test_files` in your home directory**:

     ```bash
     mkdir ~/test_files
     ```

  2. **Navigate to the `test_files` directory**:

     ```bash
     cd ~/test_files
     ```

  3. **Create three empty files named `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, and `file3.txt`**:

     ```bash
     touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt
     ```

  4. **Copy `file1.txt` to a new file named `copy_of_file1.txt`**:

     ```bash
     cp file1.txt copy_of_file1.txt
     ```

  5. **Move `file2.txt` to your Documents directory**:

     ```bash
     mv file2.txt ~/Documents/
     ```

  6. **Rename `file3.txt` to `renamed_file3.txt`**:

     ```bash
     mv file3.txt renamed_file3.txt
     ```

  7. **Delete `copy_of_file1.txt`**:

     ```bash
     rm copy_of_file1.txt
     ```

  8. **Attempt to delete the `test_files` directory using `rmdir`**:

     ```bash
     cd ~
     rmdir test_files
     ```

     - **Question**: Why did the command fail?

     - **Answer**: Because `test_files` is not empty. `rmdir` only deletes empty directories.

  9. **Delete the `test_files` directory and its contents using `rm`**:

     ```bash
     rm -r test_files
     ```

### Exercise 2: Combining File Operations and Permissions

- **Task**: Set appropriate permissions and perform file operations.

  1. **Create a directory named `shared_data`**:

     ```bash
     mkdir ~/shared_data
     ```

  2. **Copy some files into `shared_data`**:

     ```bash
     cp ~/Documents/*.txt ~/shared_data/
     ```

  3. **Set the permissions so that all users can read and execute files in `shared_data` but only the owner can write**:

     ```bash
     chmod -R 755 ~/shared_data
     ```

  4. **Verify the permissions**:

     ```bash
     ls -l ~/shared_data
     ```

  5. **Move `shared_data` to `/tmp` directory** (requires sudo if moving outside your home directory):

     ```bash
     sudo mv ~/shared_data /tmp/
     ```

  6. **Delete `shared_data` from `/tmp`**:

     ```bash
     sudo rm -r /tmp/shared_data
     ```

# Understanding Disk Usage with `du` and Similar Commands

In managing files and directories, it's crucial to monitor disk space usage to prevent running out of storage, optimize system performance, and manage resources effectively. Linux provides several commands for checking disk usage and file system information, including `du`, `df`, and `stat`. This section will cover these commands in detail, providing examples and practical applications.

## The `du` Command

### Introduction to `du`

The `du` (Disk Usage) command estimates and displays the disk space used by files and directories. It's particularly useful for identifying large files or directories consuming significant storage.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
du [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
```

- **`FILE`**: Specifies the file or directory to analyze. If none is provided, `du` uses the current directory.

### Commonly Used Options

- **`-h`** or **`--human-readable`**: Displays sizes in human-readable format (e.g., K, M, G).
- **`-s`** or **`--summarize`**: Displays only the total size for each argument.
- **`-a`** or **`--all`**: Includes files as well as directories.
- **`-c`** or **`--total`**: Produces a grand total.
- **`-d N`** or **`--max-depth=N`**: Displays directory depths of N.
- **`--exclude=PATTERN`**: Excludes files matching the pattern.

### Examples

- **Display disk usage of the current directory in human-readable format:**

  ```bash
  du -h
  ```

- **Summarize total disk usage of a directory:**

  ```bash
  du -sh /home/jane/Documents
  ```

- **Display disk usage for all files and directories recursively:**

  ```bash
  du -ah /var/log
  ```

- **Display disk usage up to a depth of 1 level:**

  ```bash
  du -h --max-depth=1 /home/jane
  ```

- **Exclude certain directories or files:**

  ```bash
  du -h --exclude='*.txt' /home/jane
  ```

### Practical Applications

- **Identify Large Directories:**

  To find out which directories are consuming the most space:

  ```bash
  du -h --max-depth=1 /home/jane | sort -hr
  ```

  - **`sort -hr`**: Sorts the output numerically in human-readable format, in reverse order (largest first).

- **Monitor Disk Usage Over Time:**

  Set up a cron job to log disk usage periodically for monitoring purposes.

- **Clean Up Disk Space:**

  By identifying large files or directories, you can decide which ones to compress, archive, or delete.

## The `df` Command

### Introduction to `df`

The `df` (Disk Free) command reports file system disk space usage, showing the amount of space available on the file system containing each file name argument.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
df [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
```

- **`FILE`**: Specifies the file or directory whose file system you want to check. If none is provided, `df` displays information for all mounted file systems.

### Commonly Used Options

- **`-h`** or **`--human-readable`**: Prints sizes in human-readable format.
- **`-T`** or **`--print-type`**: Displays the type of file system.
- **`-i`** or **`--inodes`**: Displays inode information instead of block usage.
- **`-a`** or **`--all`**: Includes dummy file systems.
- **`-t TYPE`** or **`--type=TYPE`**: Displays only file systems of the specified type.
- **`-x TYPE`** or **`--exclude-type=TYPE`**: Excludes file systems of the specified type.

### Examples

- **Display disk space usage in human-readable format:**

  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

- **Display file system types:**

  ```bash
  df -Th
  ```

- **Display inode information:**

  ```bash
  df -i
  ```

- **Check disk space for a specific file or directory:**

  ```bash
  df -h /home/jane/Documents
  ```

### Practical Applications

- **Monitor Disk Space Usage:**

  Regularly check available disk space to prevent running out of storage.

- **Check Specific File Systems:**

  Identify which file systems are nearing capacity and require attention.

- **Inode Usage Monitoring:**

  Sometimes a file system may run out of inodes (number of files) before disk space; use `df -i` to monitor inode usage.

## The `stat` Command

### Introduction to `stat`

The `stat` command displays detailed information about files or file systems, including size, permissions, timestamps, and more.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
stat [OPTIONS] FILE...
```

### Commonly Used Options

- **`-f`** or **`--file-system`**: Displays file system status instead of file status.
- **`-c FORMAT`** or **`--format=FORMAT`**: Uses a custom format instead of the default.
- **`--printf=FORMAT`**: Similar to `-c` but does not output a trailing newline.

### Examples

- **Display detailed information about a file:**

  ```bash
  stat file.txt
  ```

- **Display only the size of a file in bytes:**

  ```bash
  stat -c %s file.txt
  ```

- **Display file system information:**

  ```bash
  stat -f /home/jane
  ```

- **Display last access, modification, and change times:**

  ```bash
  stat -c 'Accessed: %x\nModified: %y\nChanged: %z' file.txt
  ```

### Practical Applications

- **Check File Metadata:**

  Get detailed information about a file's permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

- **Monitor File System Statistics:**

  Use `stat -f` to retrieve information like total blocks, free blocks, and maximum filename length.

- **Automate File Checks in Scripts:**

  Use `stat` in scripts to make decisions based on file sizes, timestamps, or permissions.

## The `duf` Command (Disk Usage Free Utility)

### Introduction to `duf`

`duf` is a modern, user-friendly alternative to `df` and `du`, providing an overview of disk usage in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format. Note that `duf` may not be installed by default and may require installation.

### Basic Usage

```bash
duf [OPTIONS]
```

### Features

- **Colorized Output:** Enhances readability.
- **Interactive Mode:** Allows for dynamic filtering and navigation.
- **Supports Multiple Platforms:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

### Example

- **Display Disk Usage:**

  ```bash
  duf
  ```

  Sample Output:

  ```

## The `lsof` Command (List Open Files)

### Introduction to `lsof`

The `lsof` command lists information about files opened by processes. In Linux, everything is a file, including network connections and devices, making `lsof` a versatile tool.

### Basic Syntax

```bash
lsof [OPTIONS] [FILES]
```

### Commonly Used Options

- **`-u USER`**: Lists open files by a specific user.
- **`-p PID`**: Lists files opened by a specific process ID.
- **`-i [4|6][protocol][@hostname|hostaddr][:port]`**: Lists network files.
- **`+D /path`**: Lists files under a specific directory.
- **`-t`**: Outputs process IDs only.

### Examples

- **List all open files:**

  ```bash
  lsof
  ```

- **List files opened by a specific user:**

  ```bash
  lsof -u jane
  ```

- **List files opened by a specific process:**

  ```bash
  lsof -p 1234
  ```

- **List network connections:**

  ```bash
  lsof -i
  ```

- **Find processes using a specific file or directory:**

  ```bash
  lsof /var/log/syslog
  ```

### Practical Applications

- **Troubleshooting File Locks:**

  Identify processes that are keeping files open and preventing unmounting or deletion.

- **Monitoring Network Connections:**

  Check which processes are using network ports.

- **Security Auditing:**

  Detect unauthorized access to files or network connections.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Regular Monitoring:**

  Use `du` and `df` regularly to monitor disk usage and prevent issues before they arise.

- **Automate Disk Usage Reports:**

  Create scripts that generate disk usage reports and send alerts when usage exceeds thresholds.

- **Combine Commands for Powerful Analysis:**

  Use pipes and redirection to combine commands for more complex analyses.

  **Example:**

  ```bash
  du -h /home/jane | sort -hr | head -n 10
  ```

  - This command lists the top 10 largest directories or files in `/home/jane`.

- **Be Cautious with Deletion:**

  When using tools like `ncdu` or deleting files identified by `du`, ensure you understand the impact to avoid data loss.

- **Use Aliases for Convenience:**

  Create aliases in your shell configuration for commonly used command combinations.

  **Example (in `.bashrc` or `.bash_aliases`):**

  ```bash
  alias dus='du -h --max-depth=1 | sort -hr'
  ```

By incorporating these commands into your workflow, you can:

- **Efficiently Monitor Disk Usage:**

  Regularly check disk space to avoid running out of storage unexpectedly.

- **Identify and Manage Large Files:**

  Locate large files or directories that can be archived, compressed, or deleted.

- **Improve System Performance:**

  Keep your file system organized and free from clutter, which can enhance system responsiveness.

Remember, proactive disk management is far easier and less disruptive than dealing with emergencies caused by full disks. Regular use of these tools will help you maintain a healthy and efficient file system.

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use Wildcards Carefully**: When using wildcards (`*`), ensure they match only the files you intend to manipulate.

- **Interactive Mode for Safety**: Use the `-i` option with `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` to prompt before overwriting or deleting files.

- **Backup Important Data**: Before performing bulk operations, consider backing up important files.

- **Check Before Deleting**: Use `ls` to list files before deleting to confirm you are targeting the correct files.

  ```bash
  ls *.tmp
  ```

- **Avoid Using `rm -rf /`**: This command forcefully deletes all files starting from the root directory and can render your system unusable.
