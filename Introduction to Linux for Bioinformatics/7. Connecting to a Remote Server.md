# Connecting to a Remote Server

In bioinformatics, it's common to utilize remote servers or high-performance computing clusters to perform resource-intensive analyses. Being able to securely connect to these remote systems and transfer files is essential. In this section, we'll explore how to use **SSH** for remote connections and **SCP** and **SFTP** for file transfers.

## Using SSH to Connect to Remote Systems

### What is SSH?

**SSH**, or **Secure Shell**, is a cryptographic network protocol that allows secure communication between two networked devices. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by encrypting the connection, ensuring that data transmitted is protected from eavesdropping.

### Basic Usage

**Syntax:**

```bash
$ ssh [username]@[hostname or IP address]
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ ssh jane@remote.server.edu
```

This command initiates an SSH connection to `remote.server.edu` with the username `jane`.

### Steps to Connect to a Remote Server

1. **Obtain Server Details:**

   - **Hostname or IP Address:** The address of the remote server.
   - **Username:** Your account name on the remote server.
   - **Password or SSH Key:** Authentication method.

2. **Open a Terminal:**

   - On your local machine, open the terminal application.

3. **Initiate the SSH Connection:**

   - Use the `ssh` command as shown above.

4. **Accept the Host Key:**

   - On first connection, you'll be prompted to accept the server's host key fingerprint.

     ```bash
     The authenticity of host 'remote.server.edu (192.168.1.100)' can't be established.
     ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:abc123...
     Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
     ```

   - Type `yes` and press Enter.

5. **Authenticate:**

   - If using password authentication, you'll be prompted to enter your password.

     ```bash
     jane@remote.server.edu's password:
     ```

   - If using SSH keys, authentication will proceed automatically if properly configured.

6. **You're Connected!**

   - Once authenticated, you'll have access to the remote shell.

     ```bash
     Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-42-generic x86_64)
     jane@remote:~$
     ```

### SSH Key-Based Authentication

Using SSH keys enhances security and convenience by eliminating the need to enter a password every time you connect.

#### Generating an SSH Key Pair

1. **Generate the Key Pair on Your Local Machine:**

   ```bash
   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```

   - **`-t rsa`**: Specifies the type of key to create (RSA).
   - **`-b 4096`**: Specifies the key length in bits.
   - **`-C`**: Adds a comment, often your email.

2. **Follow the Prompts:**

   - **Enter file in which to save the key**: Press Enter to accept the default location (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
   - **Enter passphrase**: Optionally enter a passphrase for added security. Leave empty for no passphrase.

3. **Your Keys Are Generated:**

   - **Private Key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa` (keep this secure!)
   - **Public Key**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

#### Copying Your Public Key to the Remote Server

1. **Use `ssh-copy-id` Command:**

   ```bash
   $ ssh-copy-id [username]@[hostname]
   ```

   **Example:**

   ```bash
   $ ssh-copy-id jane@remote.server.edu
   ```

   - You'll be prompted for your password.
   - The public key is appended to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on the remote server.

2. **Manually Copy the Public Key (if `ssh-copy-id` is unavailable):**

   - **Display Your Public Key:**

     ```bash
     $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
     ```

   - **Copy the Output.**

   - **Connect to the Remote Server Using Password Authentication.**

   - **Append the Public Key to `authorized_keys`:**

     ```bash
     $ echo "paste_public_key_here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

   - **Set Correct Permissions:**

     ```bash
     $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
     ```

#### Now, Connect Using SSH Keys

You can now SSH into the remote server without entering your password:

```bash
$ ssh jane@remote.server.edu
```

**Note:** If you set a passphrase when generating the key, you'll be prompted to enter it.

### SSH Configurations and Shortcuts

You can simplify your SSH commands by configuring the `~/.ssh/config` file.

**Example `~/.ssh/config` Entry:**

```plaintext
Host remote_server
    HostName remote.server.edu
    User jane
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Now, Connect Using:**

```bash
$ ssh remote_server
```

### Port Forwarding and Tunneling

SSH allows you to forward ports, enabling secure access to services on the remote server.

**Example: Forward Remote Port 8888 to Local Port 8888:**

```bash
$ ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 jane@remote.server.edu
```

This is useful for accessing Jupyter notebooks running on the remote server.

**Fun Fact:** SSH is like a Swiss Army knifeâ€”it can do port forwarding, tunneling, file transfers, and more, all while keeping your data secure!

## Transferring Files: SCP and SFTP

### Using SCP (Secure Copy)

**SCP** is a command-line utility for securely copying files and directories between hosts.

### Basic Usage

**Syntax:**

```bash
$ scp [options] [source] [destination]
```

**Examples:**

1. **Copy a File from Local to Remote:**

   ```bash
   $ scp file.txt jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/
   ```

2. **Copy a File from Remote to Local:**

   ```bash
   $ scp jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/data.csv /local/directory/
   ```

3. **Copy a Directory Recursively:**

   ```bash
   $ scp -r project/ jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/
   ```

### Common Options

- **`-r`**: Recursively copy entire directories.
- **`-P`**: Specify an alternative port (if SSH runs on a non-standard port).

  ```bash
  $ scp -P 2222 file.txt jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/
  ```

- **`-C`**: Enable compression.

### Using SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)

**SFTP** provides an interactive interface similar to FTP but operates over an SSH connection.

### Starting an SFTP Session

**Syntax:**

```bash
$ sftp [username]@[hostname]
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ sftp jane@remote.server.edu
```

### Common SFTP Commands

- **`ls`**: List files on the remote server.
- **`pwd`**: Print the remote working directory.
- **`lcd`**: Change the local directory.
- **`lpwd`**: Print the local working directory.
- **`get [remote_file]`**: Download a file from the remote server.
  
  ```sftp
  sftp> get data.csv
  ```

- **`put [local_file]`**: Upload a file to the remote server.
  
  ```sftp
  sftp> put results.txt
  ```

- **`mkdir [directory]`**: Create a directory on the remote server.
- **`rmdir [directory]`**: Remove a directory on the remote server.
- **`exit`** or **`bye`**: Close the SFTP session.

### Transferring Multiple Files

- **Wildcard Characters:**

  - You can use wildcards like `*` to transfer multiple files.

    ```bash
    $ scp jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/data/*.fastq /local/directory/
    ```

- **Batch File Transfer with SFTP:**

  - Use the `mget` and `mput` commands within SFTP.

    ```sftp
    sftp> mget *.fastq
    ```

### Resuming Interrupted Transfers with `rsync`

While not part of the standard SCP/SFTP tools, **`rsync`** is a powerful utility for synchronizing files and directories, and it can resume transfers.

**Basic Usage:**

```bash
$ rsync -avz [source] [destination]
```

**Example:**

```bash
$ rsync -avz project/ jane@remote.server.edu:/home/jane/project/
```

**Options:**

- **`-a`**: Archive mode (preserves permissions, timestamps).
- **`-v`**: Verbose output.
- **`-z`**: Compress data during the transfer.
- **`--progress`**: Show progress during transfer.

**Advantages of `rsync`:**

- Resumes interrupted transfers.
- Transfers only changed files or parts of files.

## Security Considerations

- **Use Strong Passwords and SSH Keys:**

  - Prefer SSH keys over passwords.
  - Use passphrases for your SSH keys and consider using an SSH agent.

- **Keep Your Private Key Secure:**

  - Never share your private key.
  - Set proper permissions:

    ```bash
    $ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```

- **Be Wary of Host Key Warnings:**

  - If you see a warning about the remote host identification changing, it could indicate a security issue (like a man-in-the-middle attack).

    ```bash
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    @    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
    @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
    ```

  - Investigate before proceeding.

- **Use `scp` and `sftp` over Unsecured Methods:**

  - Avoid using FTP or Telnet, as they transmit data in plaintext.
