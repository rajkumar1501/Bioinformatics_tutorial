## Introduction to Bash Scripting

### What is Bash?

Bash (**B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell) is the default command-line shell on most Linux distributions and macOS. It's a command interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file. Bash provides a powerful scripting language that can automate complex tasks by combining commands and controlling their execution flow.

### What is a Bash Script?

A bash script is a plain text file containing a series of commands that the bash shell can execute sequentially. Scripts can include variables, functions, loops, and conditionals, making them capable of performing complex operations.

**Example of a Simple Bash Script (`hello_world.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Applications in Bioinformatics

Bioinformatics often involves processing large amounts of data, running analyses, and managing computational workflows. Bash scripting can significantly enhance productivity in the following ways:

### Data Processing

- **File Manipulation**: Automate the organization, renaming, or conversion of large numbers of files.
- **Data Extraction**: Extract specific information from data files using tools like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`.
- **Format Conversion**: Convert data between different formats (e.g., FASTQ to FASTA).

### Pipeline Automation

- **Workflow Management**: Create end-to-end pipelines that process raw data to final results.
- **Tool Integration**: Combine bioinformatics tools (e.g., `bwa`, `samtools`, `bcftools`) in scripts to automate analyses.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilize loops and job scheduling to process multiple datasets simultaneously.

### Example Applications

- **Genome Assembly**: Automate the steps of assembling genome sequences from raw reads.
- **Variant Calling**: Create pipelines to identify genetic variants across multiple samples.
- **Data Analysis**: Automate statistical analyses and generate reports from bioinformatics data.

## Key Concepts in Bash Scripting

### 1. Shebang (`#!`)

The shebang line specifies the interpreter to execute the script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures the script runs with the correct shell.
- **Placement**: Must be the first line in the script.

### 2. Comments

Comments start with `#` and are ignored by the shell.

```bash
# This is a comment
```

### 3. Variables

Variables store data that can be used and manipulated in scripts.

#### Declaring Variables

```bash
variable_name="value"
```

- No spaces around `=`.
- Variables are case-sensitive.

#### Accessing Variables

```bash
echo $variable_name
```

#### Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
greeting="Hello, Bioinformatics!"
echo $greeting
```

### 4. Command Substitution

Store the output of a command in a variable.

```bash
current_date=$(date)
```

### 5. Arithmetic Operations

Perform calculations using the `$((expression))` syntax.

```bash
sum=$((5 + 3))
echo $sum  # Outputs 8
```

### 6. Conditionals

#### If Statements

```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    # Commands
elif [ condition ]; then
    # Commands
else
    # Commands
fi
```

#### Comparison Operators

- **Numerical**:
  - `-eq`: equal
  - `-ne`: not equal
  - `-lt`: less than
  - `-le`: less than or equal
  - `-gt`: greater than
  - `-ge`: greater than or equal

- **String**:
  - `=`: equal
  - `!=`: not equal
  - `-z`: string is null
  - `-n`: string is not null

#### Example

```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=10
if [ $count -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "Count is greater than zero."
else
    echo "Count is zero or less."
fi
```

### 7. Loops

#### For Loops

```bash
for variable in list; do
    # Commands
done
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.fastq; do
    echo "Processing $file"
    # Commands to process the file
done
```

#### While Loops

```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    # Commands
done
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count is $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

### 8. Functions

Define reusable blocks of code.

```bash
function_name() {
    # Commands
}
```

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
greet() {
    echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
```

### 9. Input/Output Redirection

- **Standard Output (`>`):** Redirects output to a file.
- **Standard Input (`<`):** Takes input from a file.
- **Appending (`>>`):** Appends output to a file.
- **Pipelines (`|`):** Passes output of one command as input to another.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
grep "gene" annotations.gff > genes.txt
```

### 10. Command-Line Arguments

Accessed within the script using `$1`, `$2`, etc.

- **`$0`**: The script name.
- **`$#`**: Number of arguments.
- **`$@`**: All arguments as a list.

**Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
```

## Practical Examples in Bioinformatics

### Example 1: Batch Renaming Files

**Task:** Rename all `.txt` files to `.csv`.

**Script (`rename_files.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
for file in *.txt; do
    new_name="${file%.txt}.csv"
    mv "$file" "$new_name"
    echo "Renamed $file to $new_name"
done
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses parameter expansion `${file%.txt}` to remove `.txt` extension.
- Renames files using `mv`.

### Example 2: Automating Sequence Alignment

**Task:** Align multiple FASTQ files using `bwa` and process with `samtools`.

**Script (`align_sequences.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define reference genome
reference_genome="reference.fasta"

# Index the reference genome (if not already indexed)
if [ ! -f "${reference_genome}.bwt" ]; then
    bwa index "$reference_genome"
fi

# Loop through FASTQ files and perform alignment
for sample in *.fastq; do
    sample_name="${sample%.fastq}"
    # Align reads to the reference genome
    bwa mem "$reference_genome" "$sample" > "${sample_name}.sam"
    # Convert SAM to BAM
    samtools view -bS "${sample_name}.sam" > "${sample_name}.bam"
    # Sort BAM file
    samtools sort "${sample_name}.bam" -o "${sample_name}_sorted.bam"
    # Index BAM file
    samtools index "${sample_name}_sorted.bam"
    echo "Processed $sample"
done
```

**Explanation:**

- Checks if the reference genome is indexed.
- Loops through each FASTQ file.
- Performs alignment with `bwa mem`.
- Converts and sorts the alignment files using `samtools`.

### Example 3: Parsing and Extracting Data

**Task:** Extract gene IDs from a GFF file and save them to a list.

**Script (`extract_gene_ids.sh`):**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
grep -w "gene" annotations.gff | awk '{ print $9 }' | sed 's/.*ID=\([^;]*\);.*/\1/' > gene_ids.txt
echo "Extracted gene IDs to gene_ids.txt"
```

**Explanation:**

- Uses `grep` to find lines containing "gene".
- Uses `awk` to print the 9th field (attributes).
- Uses `sed` to extract the gene ID from the attributes.
- Outputs the list of gene IDs to `gene_ids.txt`.
