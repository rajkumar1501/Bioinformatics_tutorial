### **Errors in Python**

#### **Introduction**

Errors are an inevitable part of programming. They occur when the Python interpreter encounters something it doesn't understand or can't execute. Understanding errors is crucial because they provide valuable information that helps you debug your code. As a biologist learning Python, you'll encounter various types of errors, and learning how to interpret and fix them will make your coding experience smoother and more productive.

#### **Types of Errors**

Python errors are generally categorized into three main types:

1. **Syntax Errors**: Occur when the code violates Python's syntax rules.
2. **Runtime Errors (Exceptions)**: Happen during code execution due to illegal operations.
3. **Logical Errors**: The code runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

Let's explore each type with examples relevant to biology.

---

#### **1. Syntax Errors**

**Definition**: Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter can't understand a line of code due to incorrect syntax.

**Common Causes**:

- Missing colons (`:`) at the end of control structures.
- Improper indentation.
- Misspelled keywords or function names.
- Unmatched parentheses, brackets, or quotes.

**Example**:

```python
# Incorrect syntax: missing colon and indentation
def calculate_gc_content(sequence)
gc = (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence) * 100
return gc
```

**Error Message**:

```
  File "script.py", line 2
    gc = (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence) * 100
    ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: Missing colon (`:`) after the function definition and improper indentation.
- **Solution**:

  ```python
  def calculate_gc_content(sequence):
      gc = (sequence.count('G') + sequence.count('C')) / len(sequence) * 100
      return gc
  ```

---

#### **2. Runtime Errors (Exceptions)**

**Definition**: Runtime errors occur while the program is running and lead to the program's termination if not handled.

**Common Exceptions**:

- **NameError**: Referring to a variable that hasn't been defined.
- **TypeError**: Performing an operation on incompatible types.
- **ZeroDivisionError**: Dividing a number by zero.
- **IndexError**: Accessing an index that doesn't exist in a list or string.
- **KeyError**: Accessing a key that doesn't exist in a dictionary.
- **FileNotFoundError**: Trying to open a file that doesn't exist.

**Examples and Fixes**:

**a. NameError**

```python
# Trying to print a variable that hasn't been defined
print(gene_sequence)
```

**Error Message**:

```
NameError: name 'gene_sequence' is not defined
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: `gene_sequence` hasn't been defined before use.
- **Solution**: Ensure the variable is defined.

  ```python
  gene_sequence = "ATGCGTAC"
  print(gene_sequence)
  ```

**b. TypeError**

```python
# Adding a string and an integer
num_genes = 5
message = "The number of genes is: " + num_genes
print(message)
```

**Error Message**:

```
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: Cannot concatenate a string with an integer.
- **Solution**: Convert the integer to a string.

  ```python
  num_genes = 5
  message = "The number of genes is: " + str(num_genes)
  print(message)
  ```

**c. ZeroDivisionError**

```python
# Calculating average expression level with zero samples
total_expression = 500
num_samples = 0
average_expression = total_expression / num_samples
print(average_expression)
```

**Error Message**:

```
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: Dividing by zero is undefined.
- **Solution**: Check if `num_samples` is zero before dividing.

  ```python
  if num_samples != 0:
      average_expression = total_expression / num_samples
      print(average_expression)
  else:
      print("Number of samples is zero; cannot compute average.")
  ```

**d. IndexError**

```python
# Accessing an index outside the list range
genes = ["BRCA1", "TP53", "EGFR"]
print(genes[3])
```

**Error Message**:

```
IndexError: list index out of range
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: Lists are zero-indexed; `genes[3]` is the fourth element, which doesn't exist.
- **Solution**: Use a valid index.

  ```python
  print(genes[2])  # This will print "EGFR"
  ```

**e. KeyError**

```python
# Accessing a non-existent key in a dictionary
gene_expression = {"BRCA1": 75, "TP53": 60}
print(gene_expression["EGFR"])
```

**Error Message**:

```
KeyError: 'EGFR'
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: The key `'EGFR'` doesn't exist in the dictionary.
- **Solution**: Check if the key exists before accessing.

  ```python
  if "EGFR" in gene_expression:
      print(gene_expression["EGFR"])
  else:
      print("EGFR expression data not available.")
  ```

**f. FileNotFoundError**

```python
# Attempting to read a non-existent file
with open("non_existent_file.txt", 'r') as file:
    data = file.read()
```

**Error Message**:

```
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'non_existent_file.txt'
```

**Explanation and Fix**:

- **Problem**: The file doesn't exist in the specified directory.
- **Solution**: Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists.

  ```python
  import os

  file_path = "data/sequence.txt"
  if os.path.exists(file_path):
      with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
          data = file.read()
  else:
      print(f"File {file_path} not found.")
  ```

---

#### **3. Logical Errors**

**Definition**: Logical errors occur when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results due to flaws in the logic.

**Example**:

```python
# Function to calculate the percentage of adenine (A) in a DNA sequence
def calculate_adenine_percentage(sequence):
    adenine_count = sequence.count('A')
    percentage = adenine_count / 100  # Incorrect calculation
    return percentage

dna_sequence = "ATGCGATACGCTTACG"
adenine_percentage = calculate_adenine_percentage(dna_sequence)
print(f"Adenine Percentage: {adenine_percentage}%")
```

**Issue**:

- **Problem**: Dividing the adenine count by 100 doesn't give the percentage relative to the sequence length.
- **Solution**: Divide by the length of the sequence and multiply by 100.

  ```python
  def calculate_adenine_percentage(sequence):
      adenine_count = sequence.count('A')
      percentage = (adenine_count / len(sequence)) * 100
      return percentage
  ```

#### **Understanding Error Messages**

Python error messages provide valuable information:

- **Error Type**: Indicates the kind of error (e.g., `SyntaxError`, `TypeError`).
- **Error Message**: Describes what went wrong.
- **Traceback**: Shows the sequence of function calls that led to the error, pointing to the exact line number.

**Example of a Traceback**:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 10, in <module>
    result = calculate_expression_level(total_counts, num_samples)
  File "script.py", line 5, in calculate_expression_level
    average = total / num
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Interpreting the Traceback**:

- **Line 10**: The error occurred when calling `calculate_expression_level`.
- **Line 5**: The error originated inside the `calculate_expression_level` function.
- **Error Type**: `ZeroDivisionError` indicates a division by zero.

---

#### **Debugging Techniques**

**1. Read the Error Message Carefully**

- Error messages often point directly to the problem.
- Focus on the last line of the traceback for the error type and message.

**2. Use Print Statements**

- Insert `print()` statements to check the values of variables at different stages.

  ```python
  def calculate_gc_content(sequence):
      print(f"Sequence: {sequence}")
      g = sequence.count('G')
      c = sequence.count('C')
      print(f"G count: {g}, C count: {c}")
      gc_percent = ((g + c) / len(sequence)) * 100
      return gc_percent
  ```

**3. Use a Debugger**

- Python debuggers like `pdb` allow you to step through code line by line.

  ```python
  import pdb

  pdb.set_trace()
  ```

- Alternatively, use integrated development environments (IDEs) like PyCharm or Visual Studio Code with built-in debugging tools.

**4. Check for Common Mistakes**

- **Variable Names**: Ensure consistent and correct variable names.
- **Indentation**: Python relies on indentation to define code blocks.
- **Data Types**: Verify that you're performing operations on compatible data types.
- **Function Arguments**: Make sure functions receive the correct number and type of arguments.

**5. Validate Assumptions**

- Double-check any assumptions about the data, such as sequence lengths or file contents.

**6. Simplify the Problem**

- Isolate the problematic part of the code by commenting out sections or testing with simpler inputs.

---

#### **Best Practices to Prevent Errors**

**1. Write Clear and Readable Code**

- Use meaningful variable names.
- Keep code blocks short and focused.

**2. Comment Your Code**

- Explain complex logic or important steps.

**3. Use Version Control**

- Tools like Git allow you to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.

**4. Test Your Code**

- Write test cases for your functions.

  ```python
  def test_calculate_gc_content():
      sequence = "ATGC"
      expected = 50.0
      result = calculate_gc_content(sequence)
      assert result == expected, f"Expected {expected}, got {result}"
  ```

- Run your tests regularly to catch errors early.

**5. Handle Exceptions**

- Anticipate potential errors and handle them gracefully.

  ```python
  try:
      average_expression = total_expression / num_samples
  except ZeroDivisionError:
      average_expression = 0
      print("Warning: Number of samples is zero. Average expression set to 0.")
  ```

---

#### **Examples in Biological Context**

**Example 1: Parsing a FASTA File**

```python
from Bio import SeqIO

def read_fasta(file_path):
    try:
        sequences = []
        for record in SeqIO.parse(file_path, "fasta"):
            sequences.append(record.seq)
        return sequences
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"File {file_path} not found.")
        return []
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return []
```

- **Potential Errors**:
  - `FileNotFoundError`: File doesn't exist.
  - `Exception`: Any other unforeseen error.

**Example 2: Translating DNA to Protein**

```python
def translate_dna(sequence):
    try:
        protein = sequence.translate(to_stop=True)
        return protein
    except AttributeError:
        print("Invalid sequence object. Expected a Biopython Seq object.")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during translation: {e}")
        return None

from Bio.Seq import Seq

dna_seq = Seq("ATGGCCATTGTAATGGGCCGCTGAAAGGGTGCCCGATAG")
protein_seq = translate_dna(dna_seq)
if protein_seq:
    print(f"Translated Protein Sequence: {protein_seq}")
```

- **Potential Errors**:
  - `AttributeError`: If `sequence` is not a `Seq` object.
  - General `Exception`: Catches other unexpected errors.
